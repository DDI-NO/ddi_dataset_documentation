# Medical History (MH)

## Overview
CRF Part I: Includes Social information, Family history, Current medical history (participant and informant), Current medication, Stimulants, Other bodily functions, Previous medical history and Geriatric depression scale

The Medical History experiment collects comprehensive health and lifestyle information from participants through multiple sections.

## Administration
Includes fields for test leader, test location, and CRF version tracking.

## Sections

- **Social Information**: Demographic and social background details
- **Family History**: Hereditary health conditions and family medical background
- **Current Medical History-Participant**: Active health conditions reported by the participant
- **Current Medication**: Medications currently being taken
- **Stimulants**: Use of stimulant substances
- **Other Bodily Functions**: Additional physiological or functional information
- **Previous Medical History**: Past medical conditions and treatments
- **Geriatric Depression Scale**: Standardized depression screening assessment
- **Current Medical History-Informant**: Health conditions reported by an informant (when available)
- **Relatives' Stress Scale (RSS)**: Standardized stress measurement for relatives
